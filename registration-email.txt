All,

You are officially registered for the R bootcamp at UC Berkeley August
20-21. I'll be passing along more information as the time gets closer.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible.

Thanks,
