All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 18-19 at Berkeley.
I hope to be able to let you attend, but we give first preference to
Berkeley graduate students and postdocs. We should be able to let you know
more firmly in early-mid August, though in some cases I end up admitting
waitlistees only a day or two before the bootcamp as cancellations come in.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible (which I can do better if I can
process the waitlist efficiently).
