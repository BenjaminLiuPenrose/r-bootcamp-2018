All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 20-21 at Berkeley.
I hope to be able to let you attend, but we give first preference to
Berkeley graduate students and postdocs. We should be able to let you know
more firmly in early-mid August. Note that for those receiving this who 
are undergraduates, taking Statistics 133 is
a good way to learn R and about computing with data more generally.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible.

Thanks,
