All, this email has important logistical information about the bootcamp. Please read it carefully.

1) We have over 100 people on the waitlist. If you don't show up, you've prevented someone from attending. Please fill out the cancellation form at whatever point you realize you can't make it. That includes the day before (though ideally you can let us know earlier so the waitlisted folks have more warning).

2) I've added each of you to the Piazza site for the class. This has all the logistical info and is also where we'll answer questions. Briefly, the bootcamp starts at 8:15 am on Saturday August 20 in GPB 100. Full info here:

If you haven't already registered with Piazza you will need to do so. You should have gotten an activation email. If you have issues, let me know.

3) Please follow the instructions on the Piazza site to get R installed on your computer. If you have questions/problems, please post a note on the Piazza discussion board (https://piazza.com/class/ircjy66basm3f7).

4) All content for the bootcamp is now available. Please see the Piazza site for more details. To reduce the demand on the wireless network in the room, please try to download the material in advance. 

The bootcamp is designed to start from scratch and cover a wide
variety of R's capabilities. However we only have a couple days, so we
do move fairly quickly.

* If you have absolutely no R experience coming in, it may be helpful
to look through and try out the code in module1_basics_slides.html in
advance so that when we cover it on Saturday you are seeing it for a
second time.
* If you have a fair amount of R experience (a 4 on the registration
form), much of the material may be familiar to you. You're welcome to
just attend for the parts of the bootcamp that cover the material you
are interested in. Please see the schedule in the course materials.

5) Please bring your laptop fully charged. We will have outlets but not enough for everyone so folks will need to share.
