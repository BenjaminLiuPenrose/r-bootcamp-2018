working with data, statistical analysis, and programming in R,
with no prior knowledge assumed. Please see

The short course will have two tracks, allowing participants to

Also note that if that time does not work for you or you're interested in
other R training options, D-Lab offers very regular workshops on R at
basic and intermediate levels. See dlab.berkeley.edu/training
(but note workshops for the fall are not yet posted).
