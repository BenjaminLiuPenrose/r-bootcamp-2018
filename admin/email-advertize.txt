The Statistics Department and D-Lab are offering an introductory short
course on the statistical/data science software R on Saturday-Sunday,
August 19-20. The short course will be a thorough introduction to
working with data, statistical analysis, and programming in R,
with no prior knowledge assumed. Please see
http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/r-bootcamp-2017 for more details.
Attendance is free of charge.

If you are interested in attending, please register at https://goo.gl/Kpsisf.

If you have questions about the bootcamp, please email
r-bootcamp@lists.berkeley.edu.

Also note that if that time does not work for you or you're interested in
other R training options (including an introduction at a more relaxed pace),
D-Lab offers very regular workshops on R at basic and intermediate levels.
See dlab.berkeley.edu/training (but note workshops for the fall are not
yet posted).
