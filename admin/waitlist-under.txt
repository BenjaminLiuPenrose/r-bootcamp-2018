All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 19-20 at Berkeley.
I hope to be able to let you attend, but we give first preference to
Berkeley graduate students and postdocs, and given high demand
this year it's somewhat unlikely we'll be able to offer you a seat. 
We should be able to let you know more firmly in early-mid August. 

Note that for those receiving this who are undergraduates, taking Statistics 133 is
a good way to learn R and about computing with data more generally.
In addition, the various courses in the Data Science Education Program
will teach you either Python or R as part of learning data science, so
those are good options too.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible.
