All,

You are officially registered for the R bootcamp at UC Berkeley August
19-20. I'll be passing along more information as the time gets closer.

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's VERY important
that you cancel your registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible. We've had overwhelming demand
this year, so anyone who doesn't show up will prevent someone
else from attending. So if you find out you can't make it, please cancel
your registration at goo.gl/8iXTWr

Related to the above, I'll also note that the bootcamp does not assume
any prior knowledge of R, but it is fast-paced as part of an effort to
cover a fairly wide range of what is possible with R. So
for those of you who have neither done any programming (e.g., Python, C, Java,
Fortran, R, MATLAB) nor done any script-based data analysis (e.g., R,
Python, MATLAB, Stata, SAS) before, you may want to instead consider
the R trainings offered by the D-Lab throughout the fall and spring
semesters, in particular this training the week before the bootcamp:
 http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/r-fundamentals-part-1-5
 http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/r-fundamentals-part-2-5
 http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/r-fundamentals-part-3-5
 http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/r-fundamentals-part-4-5.
These go at a slower pace so may be a good option for those
looking for a more relaxed introduction.

Thanks,
Chris Paciorek
