All, you're on the waitlist for the R bootcamp Aug 20-21 at Berkeley.
We give first preference to Berkeley graduate students and postdocs
so you're at the top of the waitlist. In general there is often
a lot of flux in the registration up through the day before the 
bootcamp, so I think it's likely that many of you will be able to
attend, but I may not be able to let you know until the week of the
bootcamp. 

In the meantime, if you realize you cannot make it, it's important
that you cancel your waitlisted registration using the link below so we can
accommodate as many people as possible.
